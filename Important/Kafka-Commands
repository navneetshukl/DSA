#First go to the location where kafka is stored.In my case it is C:/kafka

1.Start ZooKeeper (Required for Kafka):

    Kafka relies on Apache ZooKeeper, so you need to start ZooKeeper first.

    Open a command prompt and navigate to your Kafka directory (C:\kafka).

    Run the following command to start ZooKeeper:

    shell

    .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

2.Start Kafka Server:

    Open a new command prompt window (keep ZooKeeper running in the previous one) and navigate to your Kafka directory.

    Run the following command to start the Kafka server:

    shell

    .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

    Kafka should now be up and running on your local machine.

3.Create Kafka Topics:

    You can create Kafka topics using the kafka-topics.bat script. For example, to create a topic named "my-topic," use the following command:

    shell

    .\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

    Adjust the topic name, partitions, and replication factor as needed.

4.Produce and Consume Messages:

    You can now use the kafka-console-producer.bat and kafka-console-consumer.bat scripts to produce and consume messages from your Kafka topic.

    To produce messages to "my-topic," open a new command prompt and run:

    shell

.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

To consume messages from "my-topic," open another command prompt and run:

shell

        .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning

You now have Kafka running on your Windows machine, and you can start producing and consuming messages. Remember to stop the Kafka server and ZooKeeper when you're done using them.
